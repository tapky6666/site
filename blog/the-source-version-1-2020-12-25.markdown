After hours of work and adjustment, I have finally finished version 1 of my
tabletop roleplaying game The Source. It is available on
[itch.io](https://withinstudios.itch.io/q7rvfw33fw) with an added 50% discount
for readers of my blog. This discount will only last for the next two weeks.

[here](https://withinstudios.itch.io/the-source/patreon-access). Your support
gives me so much.

Merry christmas all.
