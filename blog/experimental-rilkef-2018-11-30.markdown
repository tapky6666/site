Holy cow. I am angry at how people do thing with tool. People do thing with tool so badly. You shouldn't do thing with tool, you should do other thing, compare this:

I am using tool. I want to do thing. I flopnax the ropjar and then I get the result of doing thing (because it's convenient to flopnax the ropjar given the existing program structure). 

Guess what suckers, there is other thing that I can use that is newer. Who cares that it relies on brand new experimental rilkef that only like 5 people (including me) know? You need to get with the times. I'd tell you how it's actually done but you wouldn't understand it.

Look at this graph at how many femtoseconds it takes to flopnax the ropjar vs the experimental rilkef:

What? The code for that? It's obvious, figure it out.

See? Five times as fast. Who cares that you have to throw out basically all your existing stuff, and if you mix rilkef and non-rilkef you're gonna run into problems.

So yeah, I put words on a page so you have to listen to me now. Use experimental rilkef at the cost of everything else.
