Today was my last day at my job, and as of the time that I have published this
post, I am now inbetween jobs. I have had an adventure at Lightspeed, but all
things must come to an end and my adventure has come to an end there. I have a
new job lined up and I will be heading to it soon, but for the meantime I plan
to relax and decompress.

I want to finish that tabletop RPG book I have prototyped out. When I have
something closer to a cohesive book I will post something on my
[patreon](https://www.patreon.com/cadey) so that you all can take a look. Any
and all feedback would be very appreciated. I hope to have it published on my
[Itch page](https://withinstudios.itch.io/) by the end of this year. My target
is on or about $5 for the game manual and supplemental material.

Thanks for reading; no, seriously, thank you. Without people like you that
read and share articles on this blog I would never have gotten to the level of
success that I have now. Additionally, I would like to emphasize that I am fine
as far as new jobs go. I have primary and fallback plans in place, but if they
all somehow fall through I will be sure to put up a note here. Please be sure to
check out [/signalboost](/signalboost) for people to consider when making hiring
decisions.

## May Our Paths Cross Again: My Farewell Letter to Lightspeed

Hey all,

Today is my last day at Lightspeed. Working at Lightspeed has been catalytic to
my career. I have been exposed to so many people from so many backgrounds and
you all have irreparably changed me for the better and given me the space to
thrive. There is passion here, and it is being tapped in order to create
fantastic solutions for our customers to enable them to succeed. I originally
came to Montréal to live with my fiancé and if Covid had struck a week later he
would be my husband.

However, I feel that I have done as much as I can at Lightspeed and our paths
thusly need to divide. I have gotten a fantastic opportunity and I will be
working on technology that will become a foundational part of personal and
professional IP networking over WireGuard for many companies and people. I'm
sorry if this comes as a shock to anyone, I don't mean to cause anyone grief
with this move.

I have been attaching a little poem in Lojban to the signature of my emails,
here is it and its translation:

```
la budza pu cusku lu
  <<.i ko do snura .i ko do kanro
    .i ko do panpi .i ko do gleki>> li'u
```

> May you be safe. May you be healthy. 
> May you be at peace. May you be happy.
- Buddha

I will be reachable on the internet. See https://christine.website/contact to
see contact information that will help you reach out to me. If you can, please
direct replies to me@christine.website, that way I can read them after this

I hope I was able to brighten your path.

From my world to yours,
