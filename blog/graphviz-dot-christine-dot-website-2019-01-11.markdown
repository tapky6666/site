I have been using an [online copy of GraphViz](https://github.com/dreampuf/GraphvizOnline)
for a while to make my own diagrams online. I have forked this to [here](https://github.com/Xe/GraphvizOnline) and added basic [Progressive Web App](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) support.
Here is the [link](https://graphviz.christine.website).

Here's an [example usage video](https://youtu.be/IUvbtK_nmtY).

Let me know how this works for you. Hit share->add to home screen in iOS safari to add this to your home screen as a pseudo-app.

If you ever wanted to know how to convert an existing index.html app to a progressive webapp, [here's how you do it](https://github.com/dreampuf/GraphvizOnline/compare/master...Xe:master).

Have fun.
